## About Me

Hi, I have been studying and working in web development since 2014. I like client-facing development work as it taps my creative side. I also enjoy getting into the technical challenges of server-side development as it is a great challenge.  When I'm not coding, I enjoy being outdoors, on my bicycle, hiking with my dog, or just exploring a new area.


Thank you for visiting my repository! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or opportunities.
